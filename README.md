![docat](https://github.com/docat-org/.github/blob/main/logo.png?raw=true)

**Manage your docat documentation with ease.**

[![build](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/workflows/Ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/actions)

## Getting Started

Download the [latest Release binary](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/releases/latest) for your platform
and start pushing your documentation:

```sh
docatl push --host https://docat.company.io ./docs.zip myproject v1.0.0
```

or with an implicit build:

```sh
docatl push --host https://docat.company.io ./docs/ myproject v1.0.0
```

or with an explicit build step and push an artifact:

```sh
docatl build ./docs --host https://docat.company.io --project myproject --version v1.0.0
docatl push ./docs_myproject_v1.0.0.zip
```

**Supported commands:**

* `push`: pushing documentation to a docat server
* `tag`: tag a documentation on a docat server
* `claim`: claim a documentation project on a docat server
* `delete`: delete documentation from a docat server
* `build`: build a documentation artifact to push to a docat server
* `push-icon`: push an icon for a specific documentation to a docat server
* `rename`: rename a project on a docat server
* `hide`: hide a version on a docat server
* `show`: show a previously hidden version on a docat server

## Installation

* Binaries for your platform are attached to each release [here](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/releases)
* Container images are available on ghcr.io [here](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/pkgs/container/docatl)

### Using Go

You can install the package using go directly:

```sh
go install github.com/docat-org/docatl@latest
```

The `docatl` binary will be placed in `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Using wget / curl

You can use `wget` or `curl` to download a release.
Make sure that you are using the correct version and platform names in the URL.

E.g downloading `v0.1.0` for `Linux` `x86_64`:
```sh
wget https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/releases/download/v0.1.0/docatl_0.1.0_Linux_x86_64 -O ~/bin/docatl
```

### Using docker

You can run `docatl` in a docker container:

```sh
docker run -v $PWD:/docs ghcr.io/docat-org/docatl:latest push ./docs.zip myproject v1.0.0
```

Notice that your `$PWD` will be mounted as volume to the containers `/docs` directory.
The `.docatl.yaml` and `./docs.zip` file (in the example case) are relative to that `/docs` directory.

## Ci System Support

We build a [Container Image](https://github.com/docat-org/docatl/pkgs/container/docatl) you can use
in your Ci system.

### GitLab Ci

Use the following Job template to publish the docs:

```yaml
deploy-docs:
  image: ghcr.io/docat-org/docatl:latest-alpine
  variables:
    DOCATL_HOST: https://docat.company.io
    DOCATL_API_KEY: blabla
    DOCATL_PROJECT: $CI_PROJECT_NAME
    DOCATL_VERSION: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
  script:
    - docatl push ./docs
```

Automatically tag with `latest`:

```yaml
deploy-docs:
  image: ghcr.io/docat-org/docatl:latest-alpine
  variables:
    DOCATL_HOST: https://docat.company.io
    DOCATL_API_KEY: blabla
    DOCATL_PROJECT: $CI_PROJECT_NAME
    DOCATL_VERSION: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
  script:
    - docatl push ./docs --tag latest
```

Note: you must use the `-alpine` variant on the container image, because GitLab Ci needs a shell.

## Configuration

You can configure `docatl` with either command line arguments, env variables and/or a config file (evaluated in that order of precedence).

### Config File

The config file must be at the working directory at `.docatl.yaml`, e.g.:

```yaml
host: https://docat.company.io
api-key: blabla
```

### Environment Variable

The `DOCATL_` must be used, e.g.:

```sh
DOCATL_API_KEY=blabla docatl push ...
```

## Shell auto-completion

Run `docatl completion` to install auto-completion for your shell.

## Pronounciation

`docatl` must strictly be pronounced with an Austrian accent, see proof from [@randombenj](https://github.com/randombenj) (in swiss german):

## OMG. You could have just used `curl`

Yes, absolutely. However, there are a few advantages when using `docatl`.
Some of those are:

* easily discover the interaction points with docat using `docatl help`
* easily work with configuration using a config file or environment variables
* nice error messages
* don't have to bother with all the unnessecary flags for this use case `curl` provide
* standalone binary for your platform available
* container image available to run in your Continuous Integration platform

Not convinced? Use `curl` ;)
